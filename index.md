### welcome to my homepage
This is a collection of some of my technical work related to quantitative finance. Homework sets, papers I've authored,  Python programs, and blog posts.

### Python in Finance
We use Python in some of our classes, and here is some of my work:
* [Basics notebook](https://github.com/zyuzhang/qfrm-python/blob/master/Python-Basic-notebook.ipynb)
* [Secret notebook](https://github.com/zyuzhang/qfrm-python/blob/master/python-secret-notebook.ipynb)
* [interview notebook](https://github.com/zyuzhang/Project/blob/master/python-interview-notebook.ipynb)
* [python-black-scholes-merton](https://github.com/zyuzhang/finance/blob/master/python-black-scholes-merton.ipynb)

###Python projects
* [basics](...url...)waiting for uploading.
* [programming challenges](https://github.com/pbenson/qrfm-python/blob/master/python-secret-notebook)

### Papers
* [Group Theory in Probability(chinese version)](https://zyuzhang.github.io/Group%20theory%20in%20probability.pdf)
  this paper has applied the group representation theory to some deck shuffle model and some other probability models. And a probability measure has been defined and we have got some effective results like how can we define a desk is well shuffled with the probability measure.
* [A regression model in simulation population growth](https://zyuzhang.github.io/33534.pdf) this paper has applied the AHP and regression algorithm to conduct a simulation model of population growth, and find out several factors and their weights which can contribute to population change.

### Leetcode
I have just start to use [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/) to solve some math relevant problems, and aim to practice my programming skill in C++. Here is my progress:![Leetcode](zyuzhang.github.io/1.png)

### About me
I am a grad student at the University of Michigan, in the [Quantitative Finance and Risk Management](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/quantitative-finance.html) program. I did my undergraduate work in Probability and Statistics at the [department of mathematics](http://math.ustc.edu.cn/new/En/) of [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/). I've done research with the [prof.Dangzheng Liu] (http://math.ustc.edu.cn/new/teachersinfo1.php?id=87) in the fields of the application of group representation theory in probability, my main research interest in math is stochastic analysis and Mathematical Finance. In the spare time, i will read some books and try to make some delicious food.
